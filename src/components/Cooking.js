      'Dice up all your chicken (or whatever meat you want), or cut it into small strips. Cut up vegetables in different fun shapes, about the same size. Peppers and onions should be long carrots should be circles!',

      'Start frying! Use whatever oil you like here, I like to use coconut oil, for extra flavor and high burn point.',
      'Fry up your garlic and onions first, going slow. Some nice caramelized onions are unbeatable.',
      'Add your meat. Season it in the pan so as to keep those flavors in there. You can put some salt on it before, but put all the seasonings in the pan.',
      'Add your veggies. If using a wok, use the sides to get everything all fried up nicely.',
      'Pour in the sauce and cook for 5-10 minutes until it reduces a bit and coats all the veggies and meat.',
      'Make a fried egg to put on top if you\'re feeling naughty.',
      'Serve the stir fry over rice and sprinkle sesame seeds over the top if you would like. Enjoy!'
